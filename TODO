Backlog:
-----------

Small:
** Metrics - micro / binary / additional
** Uncertainty methods - prediction intervals regression - xgboost quantiles
** raise insights to user when there are important insights he should look intp
** calibration curve for uncertainty models
** make separation quality into a report, and add sensitivity analysis for classifier model, and connect it to insights.

Big:
** Readable report (e.g. pdf)
** UI - widgets for notebooks
** Explainability   - shap / DT / KNN / linear
** Dataset quality  - values distribution in feature, recognize complex feature types
                    - Check if more data is required, Find areas with not enough samples
                    - Find anomalies / outliers in data
                    - Find anomalies / outliers in target
** Uncertainty methods - out of distribution of sample


** Advanced ML - group id, sample weight
** problem types - vision / time series / anomaly detection
